# Welcome to Charge

## First, some ground rules

Charge supports both Windows and Unix-like systems but all the *documentation* will assume a Unix-like environment.
- Commands given to the shell will assume an `sh` shell.
- The file path separator will be a forward slash.
- Environment variables will use the dollar sign for their expansion.

Windows users must interpret the commands and file paths according to their platform's specificities.
